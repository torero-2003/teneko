If you need to send a parcel or get the parcel, buy stamps and subscribe to a newspaper or a magazine, you need to go to the post-office.
You can send not only a telegram, but also a money transfer. Amicable postal workers will always help you do it. They will always tell you how to fill out the form correctly in order to avoid errors.
In some buildings of post-offices there are also special windows. You can pay there for various services such as phone, gas bills and electricity bills and so on. 
These opportunities make life of an ordinary citizen easier. Now you shouldnâ€™t waste time on trying to find the right office or bank. Everything is within reach.
Just two days ago I went to the post office to send a parcel to my niece. Since I live in Italy for a certain period of time, and my family lives in Germany, 
I had to resort to the services of the post-office. The fact is that my niece's birthday is in a week, so I wrapped up a package with gifts in advance and sent it to the appropriate address.
Postal workers asked me to pass the parcel so that they might weigh it. So did I. Then I paid for stamps that were put on the parcel. Everything went quickly and at the highest level.
I was given a check and they wished me to have a good day.
